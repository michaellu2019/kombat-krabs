## Kombat Krabs

Two Krabs (a very rare species of crab), are locked in intense, perpetual combat to the very bitter end: when one of them finally knocks the other's hat off. It is very rare to observe such a spectacle in nature for this odd species of crab. However, thanks to this toy, you can simulate this phenomenon of the animal kingdom in your own home. You can control your Krab with the button controls on your remote to knock your opponent's hat off. This game involves two players, so you better have friends to play with...

This was a project for the MIT class 2.00B - Toy Product Design.
